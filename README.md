🍔 Food Delivery Time Prediction
This project utilizes Machine Learning algorithms to predict food delivery times, enabling improved efficiency and customer satisfaction in the food delivery process.

📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to accurately predict the delivery time of food orders based on various features such as distance, order preparation time, traffic conditions, and more. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model helps optimize delivery logistics and enhance the user experience.

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
Linear Regression: A baseline model to predict delivery time based on linear relationships.
Decision Tree: A model that captures non-linear relationships by splitting data into subsets.
Random Forest: An ensemble model that improves accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.

📊 Dataset
Entries: 1,000+ (example; replace with your dataset size)
Features: Distance, weather, traffic conditions, order preparation time, and more.
Source: [Add source or describe how the dataset was created]
Size: Approximately XX MB (replace with actual size)
